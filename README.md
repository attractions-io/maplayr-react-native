**Dynamic Lighting** — Enhance map immersion with dynamic lighting and environmental effects, such as shimmering water reflections and ambient evening moonlight.

**Camera** — Supports user gestures for panning, zooming and rotating on both desktop and mobile. Or programatically control the camera's properties as desired.
